# Tutorial Log Aggregation with Python3

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will be given two log files of users which tried to attempt to log in to a web site. Both log files have different information but one column in common. Our Goal is to merge this files in to one and find information about the IP Addresses, for example from which country the users tried to access. Finally, we want wo visualize everything in google maps.

### What you'll learn
* How to merge two files in to one with Python3 by a common indicator
* How to perform a DNS-Look up with Python3
* How to receive Geolocation Data about an IP Address with Python3
* How to create a KML File and display it on Google Maps with Python3

### What you'll need
* Hacking-Lab Live CD set up
* ZIP-File with both Log Files included

## Subtask 1: Log Normalization

## Subtask 2: Log Enrichment

## Subtask 3: Display Location on Google Maps
